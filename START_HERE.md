## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Insufficient balance"
**Fix:** Get testnet MATIC from https://faucet.polygon.technology/

### "Invalid private key"
**Fix:** Make sure it starts with `0x` and has no spaces

### "Contract not found"
**Fix:** Run compilation first: `npx hardhat compile`

### MetaMask still not opening after deployment
**Fix:** 
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Check MetaMask is on Mumbai network
3. Restart frontend: `cd frontend ; npm start`

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deployment:
```
✅ Contract deployed to: 0x123...abc
✅ Frontend config updated
✅ Demo mode disabled
✅ MetaMask opens for transactions
✅ Real blockchain IDs (1, 2, 3...)
✅ 100% secure blockchain website
```

## ⚡ Just Run This:
```powershell
.\quick-deploy.ps1
```

**That's it! Your website will be 100% blockchain-secured in 5 minutes!** 🚀

## 💡 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. **Your smart contract** (FundTracker.sol) is READY ✅
2. **Your frontend** is READY ✅
3. **Your config** has a placeholder address: `0x0000...0000`
4. This triggers "demo mode" for testing
5. **Deploy script** will:
   - Deploy contract to Mumbai testnet
   - Get real contract address (0x123...abc)
   - Update frontend config automatically
   - Demo mode disables itself
   - You get REAL blockchain! 🎉

## 🔒 Security Note

**Your private key:**
- ⚠️ Keep it secret
- ⚠️ Never share it
