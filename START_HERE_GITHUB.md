## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### 1. Repository Must Exist
The repository at https://github.com/darshan-stack/Municipal must already exist. If not:
- Ask "darshan-stack" to create it
- OR create your own repository on GitHub
- OR use GitHub Desktop which can create it automatically

### 2. Credentials
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Use the Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

### 3. File Size
If you get "file too large" error:
- Delete `frontend/node_modules/` folder (it's in .gitignore)
- Run: `rm -rf frontend/node_modules` before pushing
- You can reinstall with `npm install` later
