# üéØ MILESTONE SYSTEM WITH ORACLE VERIFICATION

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

### **System Overview**
The Municipal Fund Blockchain System now includes a comprehensive **5-Milestone System (20% each)** with **Oracle Verification** and **Mandatory Quality Reports**. This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Task-based payment release
- ‚úÖ Independent verification by oracle/supervisor
- ‚úÖ Automatic fund transfer on approval
- ‚úÖ Quality accountability
- ‚úÖ Contractor eligibility tracking

## üîÑ **MILESTONE WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Project Approval**
1. Admin creates project with contractor details
2. Admin sends to supervisor (anonymous tender)
3. Supervisor reviews and approves
4. **System automatically initializes 5 milestones**
5. **Milestone 1 becomes active**

### **Step 2: Contractor Work Submission**
**URL:** Project Details ‚Üí Milestones Tab

**Contractor Actions:**
1. View active milestone
2. Click **"Submit Work for Verification"**
3. Upload proof of work documents:
   - Photos of completed work
   - Progress reports
   - Inspection certificates
   - Material receipts
4. Provide completion notes
5. Submit for oracle verification

**Submission Requirements:**
- Minimum 1 document/photo
- Completion notes required
- Cannot submit if milestone not active

### **Step 3: Oracle/Supervisor Verification**
**URL:** `/supervisor/verifications`

**Oracle Dashboard Features:**
- View all pending verifications
- See total value pending
- Review contractor submissions
- Approve or reject with feedback

**Verification Process:**
1. Oracle sees pending verification
2. Click **"Review & Verify"**
3. View all submitted documents (full screen preview)
4. Read contractor notes
5. Make decision:

#### **Option A: APPROVE**
- Provide approval feedback (optional)
- Click **"Approve & Release Payment"**
- **Automatic Actions:**
  - Milestone marked as completed
  - Payment released (20% of budget)
  - Blockchain transaction recorded
  - Next milestone automatically activated
  - Contractor receives funds

#### **Option B: REJECT**
- Provide detailed rejection feedback (required)
- Click **"Reject & Request Rework"**
- **Automatic Actions:**
  - Milestone status = "Rejected - Needs Rework"
  - Feedback shown to contractor
  - Milestone remains active for resubmission
  - Contractor can fix and resubmit

### **Step 4: Repeat for All 5 Milestones**
- Contractor completes work ‚Üí Submits ‚Üí Oracle verifies ‚Üí Payment released
- Next milestone activates automatically
- Process continues until all 5 milestones completed

### **Step 5: Quality Report Submission (MANDATORY)**
**URL:** Project Details ‚Üí Quality Report Tab

## üö´ **CONTRACTOR ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM**

### **Blocking Logic**
```javascript
IF contractor has completed project (Milestone 5 done)
   AND quality report NOT submitted
   THEN contractor CANNOT apply for new tenders
   
SHOW WARNING: "Quality report pending for project: [Project Name]"
```

### **Eligibility Check**
**Backend Endpoint:** `GET /api/contractor/{address}/can-tender`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "can_tender": false,
  "reason": "Quality report pending for project 'Highway Construction'",
  "pending_project_id": 3,
  "pending_project_name": "Highway Construction - NH48"
}
```

### **Implementation Locations**
1. **CreateProject Component:**
   - Check eligibility before allowing project creation
   - Show warning banner if blocked

2. **Tender Submission:**
   - Block tender submission button
   - Display pending quality report message

---

## üí∞ **PAYMENT FLOW**

### **Automatic Payment Release**
```
Project Budget: $100M
Each Milestone: $20M (20%)

Milestone 1 Approved ‚Üí $20M released ‚Üí Total Paid: $20M

## üìù **DEMO SCRIPT FOR HACKATHON**

### **1. Introduction (1 minute)**
*"Traditional government projects face delays due to payment disputes and lack of milestone tracking. Our system solves this with automated 5-milestone verification."*

### **2. Show Milestone Creation (30 seconds)**
*"When supervisor approves a project, 5 milestones are automatically created at 20% each. Milestone 1 activates immediately."*

### **3. Contractor Submission (1 minute)**
*"Contractor completes work and submits proof - photos, reports, certificates. System uploads to IPFS and sends to oracle for verification."*

### **4. Oracle Verification (1 minute)**
*"Independent oracle reviews work. If approved, payment releases automatically via smart contract. Next milestone activates immediately. If rejected, detailed feedback guides improvement."*

### **5. Show Progress (30 seconds)**
*"Dashboard shows real-time progress: 3/5 milestones completed, $60M released, 60% done. Full transparency."*

### **6. Quality Report (1 minute)**
*"After 100% completion, mandatory quality report required. Comprehensive metrics, compliance checklist, documentation. This ensures accountability - contractor can't apply for new projects without submitting quality report."*

### **7. Impact Statement (30 seconds)**
*"This eliminates corruption, ensures quality, automates payments, and creates permanent accountability. Every rupee tracked, every milestone verified, every project documented."*
