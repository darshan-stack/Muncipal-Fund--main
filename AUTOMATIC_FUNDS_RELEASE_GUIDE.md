# 💰 AUTOMATIC FUNDS RELEASE SYSTEM

## Overview

This system automatically releases **20% of the project budget** to the contractor's wallet when each milestone is verified by the oracle. Payments are sequential and cannot be skipped.

---

## How It Works

### Milestone Payment Structure

```
Total Project Budget: 100%

Milestone 1 (20%) → Contractor submits proof → Oracle verifies → 20% released ✅
Milestone 2 (40%) → Contractor submits proof → Oracle verifies → 20% released ✅
Milestone 3 (60%) → Contractor submits proof → Oracle verifies → 20% released ✅
Milestone 4 (80%) → Contractor submits proof → Oracle verifies → 20% released ✅
Milestone 5 (100%) → Contractor submits proof → Oracle verifies → 20% released ✅
```

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### STEP 1: Project Created by Admin

1. Admin creates project with total budget (e.g., $1,000,000)
2. Smart contract locks the budget
3. Contractor is assigned to project
4. 5 milestones are defined (20% each)

**Smart Contract State:**
```solidity
{
  projectId: 1,
  totalBudget: 1000000 USD (in MATIC/ETH),
  currentMilestone: 0,
  totalReleased: 0,
  contractorAddress: 0x123...
}
```

---

### STEP 2: Contractor Completes Milestone 1 (20%)

**What Contractor Does:**
1. Completes milestone 1 tasks:
   - Site preparation
   - Boundary marking
   - Soil testing
   - Temporary structures

2. Submits proof on blockchain:
   ```javascript
   await transactionService.submitMilestone(signer, {
     tenderId: projectId,
     percentageComplete: 20,
     completionProof: "Milestone 1 completed",
     proofImagesIPFS: "ipfs://Qm...",  // Photos of work
     gpsCoordinates: "19.0760,72.8777", // GPS verification
     architectureDocsIPFS: "ipfs://Qm...", // Architecture docs
     qualityHash: ethers.ZeroHash
   });
   ```

3. MetaMask popup appears → Contractor signs transaction
4. Transaction sent to blockchain
5. Milestone marked as "Pending Verification"

---

### STEP 3: Oracle Verifies Milestone

**What Oracle/Supervisor Does:**
1. Receives notification of milestone submission
2. Reviews proof documents:
   - ✅ IPFS images (geo-tagged photos)
   - ✅ GPS coordinates match project location
   - ✅ Architecture documents uploaded
   - ✅ Quality standards met

3. Approves milestone on blockchain:
   ```javascript
   await transactionService.approveMilestone(signer, {
     tenderId: projectId,
     milestoneNumber: 1
   });
   ```

4. MetaMask popup → Oracle signs transaction
5. Transaction confirmed

---

### STEP 4: Smart Contract Releases Funds **AUTOMATICALLY**

**This happens automatically in the smart contract:**

```solidity
function approveMilestone(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneNumber) external onlyOracle {
    Project storage project = projects[projectId];
    
    require(milestoneNumber == project.currentMilestone + 1, "Wrong milestone");
    require(project.milestoneVerified[milestoneNumber] == false, "Already verified");
    
    // Mark milestone as verified
    project.milestoneVerified[milestoneNumber] = true;
    project.currentMilestone = milestoneNumber;
    
    // Calculate 20% payment
    uint256 paymentAmount = (project.totalBudget * 20) / 100;
    
    // Transfer funds to contractor AUTOMATICALLY
    payable(project.contractorAddress).transfer(paymentAmount);
    
    // Update released amount
    project.totalReleased += paymentAmount;
    
    emit MilestoneApproved(projectId, milestoneNumber, paymentAmount);
    emit FundsReleased(projectId, project.contractorAddress, paymentAmount);
}
```

---

### STEP 5: Contractor Receives Payment

**What Contractor Sees:**

1. **MetaMask Notification:** 
   - "Received 200,000 MATIC"
   - From: Contract Address
   - To: Contractor Wallet

2. **In Dashboard:**
   ```
   ✅ Milestone 1 Verified
   💰 Payment Released: $200,000
   📊 Total Received: $200,000 / $1,000,000 (20%)
   ```

3. **Can Check on Polygonscan:**
   - Transaction Type: Internal Transaction
   - From: FundTracker Contract
   - To: Contractor Address
   - Value: 200,000 MATIC
   - Status: Success ✅
