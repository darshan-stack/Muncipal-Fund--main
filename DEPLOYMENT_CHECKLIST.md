## ⚠️ Common Pre-Deployment Errors

### Error: "Cannot find module 'hardhat'"
**Fix:**
```powershell
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

### Error: "Invalid private key"
**Causes:**
- Missing `0x` prefix
- Spaces in .env file
- Wrong key format

**Fix:**
```env
# Correct
PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef...

# Wrong
PRIVATE_KEY=1234567890abcdef...  ❌ (no 0x)
PRIVATE_KEY= 0x123...           ❌ (space before 0x)
PRIVATE_KEY=0x123 ...           ❌ (space in key)
```

### Error: "Insufficient funds"
**Fix:** Get more testnet MATIC from faucets above

### Error: "Network mumbai not found"
**Check:** hardhat.config.js has mumbai configuration

**Verify:**
```powershell
Get-Content hardhat.config.js | Select-String "mumbai"
```

Should show:
```javascript
mumbai: {
    url: "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com",
    accounts: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
    chainId: 80001,
    ...
}
```
