## üí° JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Is this just a demo?"
**A:** "No, it's deployed on Ethereum Sepolia testnet. Here's the Etherscan link with verified code."

### Q: "How do you prevent corruption?"
**A:** "Smart contract releases funds automatically. No human can delay or block payments. The code enforces rules, not officials."

### Q: "How do you prevent fake submissions?"
**A:** "GPS verification on-chain. Contractor must submit from actual project location within 500 meters. We use Haversine formula for distance calculation."

### Q: "Can citizens verify?"
**A:** "Yes, everything is on Etherscan. They can see budget, progress, transactions, and IPFS proof documents. Complete transparency."

### Q: "What about document tampering?"
**A:** "Documents stored on IPFS. Hash stored on blockchain. If document changes, hash won't match. Tamper-proof."

### Q: "How do you ensure milestone sequence?"
**A:** "Smart contract enforces 20% ‚Üí 40% ‚Üí 60% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 100%. Can't submit 40% until 20% approved. On-chain validation."

### Q: "Where's your backend?"
**A:** "Smart contract IS the backend. All logic on-chain. We have a Flask server for UI but all critical data is blockchain."

### Q: "How much does this cost?"
**A:** "Deployment: ~0.07 ETH. Each transaction: ~0.003 ETH. On mainnet: ~$20 deployment, $5/transaction. Affordable for government."

### Q: "Can this scale?"
**A:** "Yes. Layer 2 solutions like Polygon for lower costs. IPFS for document storage scales infinitely. Smart contract is stateless."

### Q: "What if GPS is spoofed?"
**A:** "GPS spoofing requires custom hardware. For government projects, we can require authenticated GPS devices or photo geolocation validation."

## üèÜ WINNING FEATURES (Mention These!)

### 1. ANTI-CORRUPTION
"Officials can't delay payments. Smart contract releases funds automatically when milestones verified."

### 2. FRAUD PREVENTION
"GPS verification prevents fake submissions. Must be at actual project site."

### 3. TRANSPARENCY
"Everything on blockchain. Citizens can verify on Etherscan. Public accountability."

### 4. AUTOMATION
"No manual approval. Rules enforced by code. Eliminates human corruption."

### 5. DECENTRALIZATION
"IPFS for documents. Smart contract for logic. No single point of failure."

```
"Municipal fund corruption costs millions. We solve it with blockchain:

1. FUNDS LOCKED on Ethereum - can't be stolen
2. GPS VERIFIED submissions - prevents fraud
3. AUTOMATIC RELEASE - eliminates corruption
4. CITIZEN PORTAL - public transparency

Deployed on Sepolia. Verified on Etherscan. Ready for production."

‚Üí Show Etherscan link
‚Üí Show one transaction
‚Üí Done!

## üî• POWER PHRASES

Use these exact phrases:
- "Verified contract on Etherscan"
- "Automatic fund release eliminates corruption"
- "GPS verification prevents fake submissions"
- "Citizens can verify everything on blockchain"
- "Tamper-proof document storage on IPFS"
- "Production-ready, not a demo"
