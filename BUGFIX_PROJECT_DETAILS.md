# üîß Bug Fix: Project Details Loading Issue

## Issue Fixed
**Problem:** When clicking "View Details" on any project (Admin, Citizen, or Supervisor pages), the application showed "Failed to load project details" error.

**Root Cause:** The backend API was missing several critical endpoints that the frontend was trying to access.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Backend Endpoints Added (`backend/server_simple.py`)
