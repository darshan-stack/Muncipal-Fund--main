# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Municipal Fund Blockchain System

## Current Status: ✅ Ready for Deployment

Your system is working locally:
- ✅ Backend running on port 5000
- ✅ Frontend compiling successfully
- ✅ Login system working for all roles
- ✅ Smart contracts ready

---

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Deploy Smart Contract Only (Recommended First)
Deploy your smart contract to a blockchain testnet (Mumbai) while keeping frontend/backend on localhost.

### Option 2: Full Production Deployment
Deploy everything to production servers (cloud hosting).

---

## 🎯 OPTION 1: DEPLOY SMART CONTRACT (Start Here)

### Step 1: Get Testnet MATIC (Free)

1. **Create/Use MetaMask Wallet**
   - Install MetaMask extension
   - Create or import a wallet
   - Copy your wallet address

2. **Get Free Mumbai Testnet MATIC**
   - Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Select "Mumbai"
   - Paste your wallet address
   - Click "Submit"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for MATIC to arrive

3. **Verify you received MATIC**
   - Open MetaMask
   - Switch network to "Mumbai Testnet"
   - Check balance > 0.5 MATIC

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Create/Edit root `.env` file:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\SAKSHI SANJAY CHAVAN\Downloads\Muncipal-Fund--main\Muncipal-Fund--main"
notepad .env
```

Add these lines (replace with your values):

```env
# Your wallet private key (KEEP SECRET!)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Mumbai RPC URL (default works)
MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com

# Optional: For contract verification
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never commit `.env` to GitHub!

---

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (If Needed)

```powershell
# Install Hardhat dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

---

### Step 4: Deploy Smart Contract

```powershell
# Deploy to Mumbai Testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying contracts with account: 0x...
Account balance: 0.5 MATIC
Contract deployed to: 0xAbC123...
✅ Deployment successful!
```

**Save the contract address!** You'll need it.

---

### Step 5: Update Frontend with Contract Address

Edit `frontend/src/config/web3Config.js`:

```javascript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourDeployedContractAddress";
export const NETWORK_ID = 80001; // Mumbai testnet
```

---

### Step 6: Test with MetaMask

1. Restart your frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3000

3. Connect MetaMask to Mumbai testnet

4. Test blockchain features (if implemented)

---

### Update Frontend to Use Production Backend

Edit `frontend/.env.production`:

```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.herokuapp.com
```

Or for Vercel, add environment variable in Vercel dashboard.
